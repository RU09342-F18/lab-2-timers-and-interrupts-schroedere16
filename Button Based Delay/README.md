# Button Based Delay
These codes are able to blink an LED at a rate decided by the user. Both of these codes initially blink an LED at roughly 10Hz until the button is pressed. Once the button is pressed a timer will start and when released the LED will begin to blink at the rate of how long the button was held. These codes are dependent on the <msp430.h> library.
